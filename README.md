- 👋 Hi, I’m @Brentimeus
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can about coding well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and a little bit of C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, but I'm afraid I would be pretty useless to you since I've only been practicing coding for two months.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
